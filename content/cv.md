_Throughout my career, I've consistently sought out challenges that push me to grow, both professionally and personally. Transitioning from law enforcement to IT in 2012 was a pivotal moment that ignited my passion for cybersecurity. I take pride in my ability to quickly adapt, learn new technologies, and overcome obstacles. My journey from help desk to subject matter expert in NOC and SOC operations, and eventually to cybersecurity and cloud security, is a testament to my commitment to continuous improvement.

Currently, I‚Äôm working toward completing my Bachelor‚Äôs in Cloud Computing and Computer Science at Western Governors University by November 2025. Immediately after, I plan to pursue a Master‚Äôs in Information Assurance, driven by my goal to remain at the forefront of the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. My certifications and hands-on experience in cloud and security operations reflect not just technical expertise, but also a deep desire to contribute meaningfully to my field.

Outside of work, I'm an avid learner and enjoy keeping up with emerging threats, best practices, and innovations in the tech space. This passion for growth and learning drives my work every day, and I‚Äôm always looking for new opportunities to enhance my skills and make a greater impact._
