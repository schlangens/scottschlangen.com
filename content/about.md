Throughout my career, I have developed a reputation as an experienced professional with the ability to configure and troubleshoot security controls for hosted technologies and technologies maintained on-premises; skilled in monitoring security measures for the protection of information resources. 

I am known to be a collaborative team player with the capacity to assist in developing comprehensive reports that measure security control performance, and which support designing and delivering system control enhancements; able to simplify sophisticated issues to make them easily comprehensible for a broader audience. 

Perhaps most important, I am a resilient individual with strong management and people skills, personal values, integrity, and technical knowledge; able to contribute to the design of computer security architectures by helping incorporate cybersecurity into each architecture's design.
