I'm a cybersecurity professional currently serving as a Cybersecurity Administrator for the City of Carmel, Indiana, where I oversee security operations and protect critical municipal infrastructure. My career has taken me from NOC and SOC operations through cloud security and threat analysis, consistently focusing on practical, effective security implementations.

Throughout my career, I've worked across diverse environments—from managed security service providers to healthcare technology, enterprise consulting, and now municipal government. This breadth of experience has given me a comprehensive understanding of security challenges across different sectors and regulatory landscapes.

I hold multiple industry certifications including CompTIA CySA+, Security+, Cloud+, AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Azure Fundamentals, and specialized training in threat intelligence and incident response. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity at Western Governors University (expected September 2027), I plan to continue with a Master's in Information Assurance to remain at the forefront of the evolving cybersecurity landscape.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm actively advancing through the Microsoft Security Compliance certification path. Currently preparing for the SC-900 (Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals), my goal is to achieve expert-level credentials in both Identity and Compliance domains. This focus aligns with the growing importance of identity-centric security and regulatory compliance in modern cybersecurity operations, particularly in municipal government environments where protecting citizen data and ensuring compliance are paramount.

My approach combines technical expertise with practical problem-solving. Whether analyzing security events, implementing defense controls, managing identity and access governance, or leading incident response efforts, I focus on solutions that effectively reduce risk while supporting business operations.

Outside of work, I maintain active engagement with the security community, continuously researching emerging threats, pursuing advanced certifications, and developing tools to support security operations.
