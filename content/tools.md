# Nerdy Tools and Projects 🛠️

Welcome to my nerdy corner of the internet! Here are a couple of cool projects that I've worked on:

## [Google (Ad-Free Edition)](https://goog.scottschlangen.com) 🚀

Enjoy the simplicity of Google search without the distractions of ads. A clean and ad-free searching experience for the true nerds!

Dive into a collection of IT tools designed for efficiency and effectiveness. From diagnostics to optimizations, these tools are here to make your tech life easier.
