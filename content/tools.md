# Nerdy Tools and Projects üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to my nerdy corner of the internet! Here are a couple of cool projects that I've worked on:

## [IR-Logger](https://github.com/schlangens/ir-logger)

This tool allows you to input entries from active IR into a markdown document. I wrote this to keep my thoughts organized.


## [EventID-Scrape](https://github.com/schlangens/EventID-Scraper)

This tool scrapes event information from Microsoft Learn and Ultimate Windows Security websites, providing a comprehensive overview of security-related Windows events.
