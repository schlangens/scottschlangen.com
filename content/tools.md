# Nerdy Tools and Projects 🛠️

Welcome to my nerdy corner of the internet! Here are a couple of cool projects that I've worked on:

## [EventID-Scrape](https://github.com/schlangens/EventID-Scraper)

This tool scrapes event information from Microsoft Learn and Ultimate Windows Security websites, providing a comprehensive overview of security-related Windows events.

## [Google (Ad-Free Edition)](https://goog.scottschlangen.com) 🚀

Enjoy the simplicity of Google search without the distractions of ads. A clean and ad-free searching experience for the true nerds!
