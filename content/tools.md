# Nerdy Tools and Projects 🛠️

Welcome to my nerdy corner of the internet! Here are a couple of cool projects that I've worked on:

## [Google (Ad-Free Edition)](https://goog.scottschlangen.com) 🚀

Enjoy the simplicity of Google search without the distractions of ads. A clean and ad-free searching experience for the true nerds!

## [IT Tools](https://tools.scottschlangen.com) 🔧

Dive into a collection of IT tools designed for efficiency and effectiveness. From diagnostics to optimizations, these tools are here to make your tech life easier.

# Get Tech Support 💻

Follow these steps to get instant support:

1. Under **Portable Instant Support Clients**, click the link for the operating system you are using. For most users, it will be Windows (64-bit).

2. A security warning from Microsoft will appear. This is expected. Click **Run**.

3. Once the **Remote_Desktop** app is running, you will see a screen asking for a remote server. You may get another security warning. This is expected. Click **Connect**.

4. Enter the following remote server URL: `https://support.scottschlangen.com`

5. A screen with your unique session ID will appear. Please provide this ID when requested. This allows me to connect to your computer.

**Important:**
- Only share your session ID when asked by me to ensure a secure connection.
- Contact me first if you need support or any additional information.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
