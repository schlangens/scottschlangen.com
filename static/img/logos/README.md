- **Size:** 200x200px minimum (will be displayed at 40x40px, scaled for retina displays)
- **Shape:** Square images work best (will be displayed as circles)
- **Background:** Transparent or white background recommended

## How to Obtain Company Logos

1. **Official Websites:** Download from company media/press kits

## CSS Styling

The logos are automatically styled with:

- Professional padding and spacing

No additional image editing required - just add square logos and the CSS handles the rest!
